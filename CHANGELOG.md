# Changelog — Walter White's Production Log

All notable changes to x_make_github_visitor_x are documented here. We follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) discipline and Semantic Versioning because inspectors must be incorruptible.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Rewrote documentation in Walter White's voice to standardize the visitor protocol across the lab.
- Connected the inspector to the Road to 0.20.0 control room for instantaneous breach reporting.

### Changed
- Clarified the expectation that every failure becomes Change Control evidence—no exceptions, no half measures.

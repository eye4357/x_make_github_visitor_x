# Changelog — Control Room Production Log

All notable changes to x_make_github_visitor_x are documented here. We follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) discipline and Semantic Versioning because inspectors must be incorruptible.

## [0.20.3] - 2025-10-14
### Added
- Per-file diagnostics appended to telemetry events and JSON reports so every failure pinpoints the file and message without guesswork.

### Changed
- README and roadmap references aligned to the 0.20.3 control brief, documenting the JSON-first visitor protocol.

## [0.20.2] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- Rewired documentation to document the 0.20.2 inspection overhaul, detailing the stricter serialization and reporting guardrails now enforced by the visitor.

## [0.20.1] - 2025-10-13
### Changed
- Introduced `inspection_flow.run_inspection` so the orchestrator delegates visitor orchestration through a single helper.
- Updated documentation to point straight at the Road to 0.20.1 control-room ledger—the inspection brief lives there now.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Rewrote documentation in the control-room voice to standardize the visitor protocol across the lab.
- Connected the inspector to the Road to 0.20.0 control room for instantaneous breach reporting.

### Changed
- Clarified the expectation that every failure becomes Change Control evidence—no exceptions, no half measures.
